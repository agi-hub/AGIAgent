Write reports according to the following template. You can write different chapters into different md files, and finally use the merge_file tool to combine them into a complete md. Do not merge them into a large md file yourself.
Require rich graphics and detailed discussion. Use long sentences, with each paragraph containing approximately 300 words.
Use connecting words such as "in terms of xxx", "on one hand, on the other hand", or "first, second, third, finally", or "first, second" etc. to connect sub-points, instead of listing sub-points in bullet format. Use rich connecting words, and adjacent paragraphs must use different connecting words.
Use examples and illustrations to explain your viewpoints.
Add sufficient details to support your viewpoints. Paragraphs should adopt a general-specific or general-specific-general structure. You can use transition words, transition sentences to connect sentences, or connect sentences through pronouns and keywords.
For each chapter, please search for relevant information from web pages, knowledge bases, and code repositories and organize it according to the requirements in the prompts.
When writing each chapter, add illustrations. You can use various chart styles of SVG/mermaid for drawing, or search for images from the internet.
Make full use of research data, analyze data with programs and generate images. Make full use of tables to elaborate data or viewpoints.

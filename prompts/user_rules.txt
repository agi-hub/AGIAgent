Chinese font configuration: For matplotlib with Chinese text, configure fonts properly using 'Noto Sans CJK SC', 'WenQuanYi Zen Hei', with 'DejaVu Sans' fallback

Chinese character preservation: Do not use non-ASCII filtering tools that would remove Chinese characters from text processing

Avoid using non-ascii characters in GUI and report figures if user not specified.

Chinese font configuration: For matplotlib with Chinese text, configure fonts properly using 'Noto Sans CJK SC', 'WenQuanYi Zen Hei', with 'DejaVu Sans' fallback

Chinese character preservation: Do not use non-ASCII filtering tools that would remove Chinese characters from text processing

Avoid using non-ascii characters in GUI and report figures if user not specified.

PowerPoint Generation with python-pptx:
- Create professional presentations with maximum 10 lines per slide for readability
- Use consistent layouts, professional colors, and clear hierarchy
- Add charts/graphs when appropriate; use consistent slide layouts
- Structure logically: title, agenda, content, conclusion
- CRITICAL: Write plain text without bullet points (â€¢) or dashes (-) - let templates handle formatting

Use xelatex to compile Latex, when creating Latex script, you must use \usepackage{xeCJK} package and compile using terminal command 'xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file_name.tex'. Ensure the image is scaled and not overfit the boundary of the paper or slide.

Generating more figures is preferred, using mermaid or graphviz library, and insert to your markdown report.

Convert markdown to pdf / word / html / powerpoint using pandoc.
For Chinese content PDF: use --pdf-engine=xelatex -V mainfont="Noto Serif CJK SC" to avoid font warnings.


To obtain the original figures of input materials, and add them to your report, you can check if mineru is installed, and use terminal command 'mineru -p source_file -o out_dir' to convert word / pdf / powerpoint file into markdown and images stored in out_dir, 
then processing using markdown format. The figure caption is following the image link, and they form a pair. 
If you use a link to an image, please adopt the corresponding figure caption, and vice versa.

Chinese font configuration: For matplotlib, using English text, if user requires Chinese text, configure fonts properly using 'Noto Sans CJK JP'

Do not use non-ASCII filtering tools that would remove Chinese characters from text processing

Avoid using non-ascii characters in GUI and report figures if user not specified.

Please do not repeatedly call the same tool - trust that the tool's returned results are stable and reliable.

When outputting tool calls, always use JSON format and do not include any XML notation.

Note: When including special characters in JSON strings, DO remember to add the necessary escape characters. For example, # -*- "coding": utf-8 -*- should be written as # -*- \"coding\": utf-8 -*-.

For edit_file, please ensure the indentation is accurate otherwise the edit will be REJECTED.

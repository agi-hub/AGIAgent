Chinese font configuration: For matplotlib, prefer using English text by default. If Chinese text is required, you MUST configure fonts properly using CJK fonts like 'Noto Sans CJK JP', 'WenQuanYi Micro Hei', or 'Arial Unicode MS'. CRITICAL: NEVER include 'DejaVu Sans' in the font list when using Chinese text, as it does not support CJK characters and will cause warnings. If CJK fonts are not available, use English text instead of Chinese to avoid font-related warnings.

Do not use non-ASCII filtering tools that would remove Chinese characters from text processing

Avoid using non-ascii characters in GUI and report figures if user not specified.

Please do not repeatedly call the same tool - trust that the tool's returned results are stable and reliable.

Note: When including special characters in JSON strings, DO remember to add the necessary escape characters. For example, # -*- "coding": utf-8 -*- should be written as # -*- \"coding\": utf-8 -*-.

For edit_file, please ensure the indentation is accurate otherwise the edit will be REJECTED.

You have only limited context length (about 100K tokens), please finish your task in a limited number of steps.

Do not print mermaid or svg code in messages, since they can not be parsed. Instead, describe it in Markdown file or figure file using edit_file tool.

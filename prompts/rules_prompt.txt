<execution_rules>
Important execution guidelines to follow:

1. Tool usage limitation: Only call ONE tool per round/response. Do not make multiple tool calls in a single response.
2. Avoid generating content based on assumptions, guesses, or file names
3. Use tools to gather actual information before responding
4. Wait for real tool results - avoid fabricating or imagining results
5. If you need file contents, use read_file tool first
6. If you need directory structure, use list_dir tool first
7. If you need to search code, use codebase_search tool first
8. For analysis/reports tasks, read actual files before creating anything
9. Avoid outputting system formats: Don't output "## Tool Execution Results:", "Tool result:"

Following these guidelines helps ensure accurate and reliable responses.
</execution_rules>

<avoid_hallucination>
Avoid Hallucinating Tool Results:
1. When calling information-gathering tools (web_search, read_file, codebase_search), do not assume or fabricate results
2. Stop the current response and wait for actual tool execution results to be returned
3. In the next round, make decisions and respond based on the real results received
4. For multi-step tasks, execute only one logical step at a time, waiting for results before proceeding
5. File editing tools (edit_file) do not need verification reading after execution - trust the tool works correctly

Ensure responses are based on actual tool results, not assumptions.
</avoid_hallucination>

<making_code_changes>
When making code changes, avoid outputting code to the user unless requested. Instead use code edit tools to implement changes.
Use code edit tools at most once per turn.
Edit file call guidelines: Limit to 2 edit_file calls per response. If you need to edit more files, prioritize the most important ones and handle the rest in subsequent responses.
Tool isolation: Avoid calling edit_file after using other tools in the same round. If you've used other tools (read_file, codebase_search, web_search, etc.), use edit_file in a separate, dedicated round.

To ensure generated code runs immediately:
1. Group edits to the same file in a single edit_file call
2. For new codebases, create appropriate dependency files (requirements.txt) and helpful README
3. For web apps, provide beautiful and modern UI with good UX practices
4. Avoid generating extremely long hashes or binary code
5. Read file contents before editing (unless creating new files). After edit_file, verification reading isn't needed for efficiency
6. Fix linter errors if clear how to, but don't loop more than 3 times on the same file
7. Chinese font configuration: For matplotlib/pygame with Chinese text, configure fonts properly using 'Noto Sans CJK SC', 'WenQuanYi Zen Hei', with 'DejaVu Sans' fallback
8. Chinese character preservation: Do not use non-ASCII filtering tools that would remove Chinese characters from text processing
9. Interactive input prohibition: Do not generate programs that require user terminal input (like input(), raw_input(), or interactive prompts). Programs should run automatically without user interaction.
10. Background execution for GUI/web apps: When launching GUI applications, web servers, or any programs with interfaces, always use run_terminal_cmd with is_background=True to prevent blocking and allow proper execution.
11. Background process cleanup: After confirming successful startup of background programs, wait a few seconds then use run_terminal_cmd to find and terminate the program (e.g., using ps, pkill, or kill commands) to avoid leaving orphaned processes running.

<searching_and_reading>
Guidelines for using search and file reading tools:
1. Prefer semantic search tool over grep search, file search, and list dir tools when available
2. Actually call these tools and wait for results - don't assume or guess file contents
3. Proceed only after receiving actual tool results
</searching_and_reading>

<web_search>
For web search usage:
- Wait for search results in the next round before outputting information
- Direct URL Access: When user provides specific URLs (http:// or https://), use web_search with the exact URL as search_term
- Consecutive search limitation: Limit to 2 consecutive web search rounds per session. After 2 searches, synthesize available information or ask for more specific guidance
- For non-research tasks, try to avoid using the `web_search` tool.
</web_search>

<task_completion>
Task Completion Signal:
When you've fully completed a task and believe no further iterations are needed, you MUST send this singal to exit the task execution:
TASK_COMPLETED: [Brief description of what was accomplished]
Note: Don't send TASK_COMPLETED signal if you calls tools in the current round, you should wait and check the tool executing result  in the next round and then send this signal.
Before sending TASK_COMPLETED, you must double check the execution results to ensure that the task has been completed correctly.
Do not send TASK_COMPLETED if you called any tools within a round, you can send in the next round.
</task_completion>

<reports>
For Report Generation Tasks:

1. Information gathering: Use tools to read actual file contents, conduct web searches, and gather data before generating reports. Avoid creating reports based only on assumptions or file names.

2. Generate detailed reports: Create comprehensive, in-depth analysis like published scholar papers.

3. Writing style: When writing report content, use coherent and continuous sentences that explain the cause and effect relationships clearly. Focus on articulating your points with logical flow and reasoning, rather than simply listing core viewpoints. Each paragraph should connect ideas smoothly and provide clear explanations of how conclusions are reached.

4. If user not specified, longer reports are perferred, you can:
   - Create an outline first, then generate content section by section. Do not generate all content at once.
   - Generate one section of the outline at a time and write each section to a separate file.
   - Organize content within each file in paragraph form. Avoid excessive bullet points or enumeration. Each paragraph must contain more than one sentence.
   - After writing all sections to separate files, merge them together to create a single final report file.

5. Output format: Generate reports in Markdown format and then convert to HTML format. For comprehensive reports, use multiple `.md` files with descriptive names (e.g., `01-executive-summary.md`). Use proper markdown syntax with clear heading hierarchy, tables, and code blocks.

6. Use pandoc to convert markdown to HTML, Word, or PDF formats:
   - HTML: `pandoc report.md -o report.html --standalone --css=style.css --toc --toc-depth=3`
   - Word: `pandoc report.md -o report.docx --reference-doc=template.docx`
   - PDF: `pandoc report.md -o report.pdf --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf --css=style.css`

7. PowerPoint Generation with python-pptx:
   - Create professional presentations with maximum 10 lines per slide for readability
   - Use consistent layouts, professional colors, and clear hierarchy
   - Add charts/graphs when appropriate; use consistent slide layouts
   - Structure logically: title, agenda, content, conclusion
   - CRITICAL: Write plain text without bullet points (â€¢) or dashes (-) - let templates handle formatting

Aim to produce comprehensive, detailed, and insightful analysis with substantial depth rather than superficial summaries.

<code_testing_and_validation>
Code Testing and Validation Requirements:
For all coding tasks, please follow these testing protocols:
Comprehensive testing approach:
   - Every piece of code should be tested before considering the task complete
   - Testing is an important part of code development
   - Code should execute correctly and produce expected results

# AGI Agent

[**‰∏≠Êñá**](README_zh.md) | **English**

## üöÄ Project Introduction

**AGI Agent** is an L3-level fully automated general-purpose intelligent agent powered by Large Language Models (LLM). It employs a multi-round iterative working mechanism where the large model can make tool calls and receive feedback results in each round. It is used to update files in the workspace or change the external environment through tools according to user needs. AGIAgent can autonomously call a wide range of MCP tools and operating system tools, featuring multi-agent collaboration, multi-level long-term memory, and embodied intelligence perception. It emphasizes the generality and autonomous decision-making capabilities of the agent. AGIAgent's extensive operating system support, large model support, and multiple operation modes make it suitable for building human-like general intelligence systems to achieve complex report research and generation, project-level code writing, automatic computer operation, multi-agent research (such as competition, debate, collaboration) and other applications.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### ü§ñ Autonomous Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Autonomous Agent Creation**: The system can autonomously decide to create new professional agents, configuring unique prompts, model types, and dedicated tool libraries for each agent
- **Role Specialization**: Build sub-agents with different roles and specialized expertise working efficiently together in a shared workspace
- **Communication Mechanism**: Agents have point-to-point and broadcast message communication capabilities, integrated with email viewing mechanisms for seamless interconnection

### üîß Extensive Tool Calling Capabilities

- **MCP Protocol Support**: Supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting thousands of extended tools such as GitHub and Slack
- **System Integration**: Full support for terminal commands, Python package management, and operating system software packages
- **Autonomous Installation**: Agents can automatically install system software, pip packages, and MCP tools according to task requirements

### üß† Long-term Memory and Learning
- **Persistent Memory**: Solves the limitation of traditional agents that only focus on current tasks by storing historical execution summaries to form long-term memory
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Extracts valuable historical memory elements for current work through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Context Management**: Integrates long-context summarization mechanisms to ensure memory continuity and relevance

### üëÅÔ∏è Embodied Intelligence and Multimodal
- **Multimodal Perception**: Built-in vision, sensors, and other multimodal capabilities, not limited to the text world
- **Physical World Interaction**: Can handle rich physical world information scenarios
- **Multi-channel Information Processing**: Achieves parallel information perception and interaction through multi-agent architecture

### üîó Flexible Deployment Methods

- **Embedded Integration**: Can be embedded as a Python component into other software processes
- **Modular Design**: Uses a building-block approach to construct powerful intelligent systems
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Depends only on a few core libraries, with a compact software package and strong system compatibility

## üîÑ Working Principle

### Input-Output Mechanism
AGI Agent receives **user prompts** and **working directory** as input, and outputs **processed working directory**. All generated code, documents, and other files are uniformly placed in the workspace folder.

### Multi-round Iterative Process
1. **Task Analysis Phase**: The system sends user prompts, historical chat records, and previous tool execution results to the large model
2. **Decision Making Phase**: The large model autonomously decides the tool calling strategy for the next round (file writing, code search, terminal commands, etc.)
3. **Tool Execution Phase**: The tool execution module parses and executes the large model's instructions (supports tool_call and JSON formats)
4. **Result Feedback Phase**: Execution results are passed to the large model in the next round, forming a closed-loop feedback
5. **Task Completion Phase**: The large model issues an end signal when it determines the task is complete, and can optionally generate a task summary

### Intelligent Optimization Features
- **Context Management**: Automatically triggers historical summarization when chat history exceeds the threshold to maintain efficient operation
- **Network Search Optimization**: Search results can be selectively summarized to extract key information
- **Security Boundaries**: All editing operations are limited within the user-defined working directory to ensure system security

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

As a general-purpose task agent, AGI Agent has the capability to call system terminal commands. Although it usually does not operate files outside the working directory, the large model may execute software installation commands (such as pip, apt, etc.). Please pay attention when using:
- Carefully review executed commands
- Recommend running important tasks in a sandbox environment
- Regularly backup important data

### Basic Usage

#### üî• Single Task Mode (Recommended)
Suitable for single-objective tasks such as bug fixes and feature optimization. If no `-r` parameter is specified, the program will prompt you to enter a task description, supporting multi-line complex prompts.

```bash
python agia.py --requirement "Search today's news"
python agia.py -r "Write a joke"

# Image input support
python agia.py -r "Analyze this chart: [img=chart.png]"

# MCP tool integration
python agia.py -r "Use AISearch_search to search for AI news"
```

#### üìã Task Decomposition Mode
Suitable for complex multi-step tasks. The system will automatically decompose large tasks into subtasks for step-by-step execution.

```bash
python agia.py --todo --requirement "Develop a complete blog system"
```

#### üí¨ Interactive Mode
Provides a more flexible interactive experience where the system guides you to input task requirements.

```bash
python agia.py -i
python agia.py --interactive 
```

#### üìÅ Specify Output Directory
Customize project output location. If not specified, the system will automatically create an `output_` directory with timestamp.

```bash
python agia.py --dir "my_dir"
```

#### üîÑ Continue Task Execution
Resume previous task execution. AGI Agent remembers the last used output directory.

```bash
python agia.py -c
python agia.py --continue
```

> **Note**: Continue execution only restores the working directory and the last requirement prompt, not the large model's context.

#### ‚ö° Set Execution Rounds
Control the maximum number of task execution rounds to avoid infinite loops.

```bash
python agia.py --loops 5 -r "Requirement description"
python agia.py -d "my_dir" -l 10 -r "Requirement description"
```

> **Note**: Rounds do not equal model call count. Each round usually calls the large model once, but may call it an additional time for summarization when chat history is too long, and may also summarize after task completion.

#### üîß Custom Model Configuration
Directly specify API configuration through command line, but it's recommended to configure in `config/config.txt` for reuse.

```bash
python agia.py --api-key YOUR_KEY --model gpt-4 --api-base https://api.openai.com/v1
```

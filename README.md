# AGI Bot

[**中文**](README_zh.md) | **English**

**AGI Bot** is an AI-powered intelligent code generation and autonomous task execution system that automatically decomposes complex tasks and completes them through multi-round iterations with tool calls.

AGI Bot takes user prompts and a working directory as input, and outputs an edited working directory where the LLM places code, documentation, and other output files in the workspace folder. AGI Bot operates in a multi-round iterative mode, where each round represents an interaction process between the LLM and tools. The system sends system prompts, user prompts, chat history, and previous tool execution results to the LLM, which then autonomously decides on the next round of tool calls (such as writing files, searching code repositories, executing terminal commands, etc.). These calls are described in XML format and then parsed and executed by the tool execution module. The execution results are passed to the LLM in the next round. When the LLM determines that the task is complete, it sends a task completion signal, and the program can optionally perform task summarization. All LLM editing operations are completed in the workspace directory under the user-defined working directory (--dir). Additionally, to control context length, chat history summarization is triggered when the chat context threshold is exceeded. Web search results can optionally be summarized.

AGI Bot runs in the terminal by default. For users with GUI or web access needs, we also provide a Web GUI that includes all the functionality needed for task execution, plus file upload/download, file preview, and task execution monitoring features.

Since AGI Bot is positioned as a general-purpose task agent, it may call system terminal commands. It generally does not operate files outside the working directory, though the LLM may sometimes call software installation commands (pip, apt, etc.). Please use this software with caution and consider sandbox execution when necessary.

## Quick Start

#### 🔥 Single Task Mode (Recommended)
Perfect for bug fixes, feature optimizations, and focused objectives. If you don't specify the `-r` parameter, the program will prompt you to enter a task description, supporting multi-line complex prompts.

```bash
python main.py --requirement "Search today's news"
python main.py -r "Write a joke"
```

#### 📋 Task Decomposition Mode
Ideal for complex multi-step tasks where the system automatically breaks down large tasks into manageable subtasks.

```bash
python main.py --r "Search today's news" --todo --requirement "Develop a complete blog system"
```

#### 💬 Interactive Mode
Provides a more flexible interactive experience with guided task input.

```bash
python main.py -i
python main.py --interactive --todo
```

#### 📁 Custom Output Directory
Specify custom project output location. If not specified, the system automatically creates a timestamped `output_` directory.

```bash
python main.py --dir "my_project"
```

#### 🔄 Resume Task Execution
Resume previous tasks for continued execution. AGI Bot remembers the last used output directory.

```bash
python main.py -c
python main.py --continue
```

> **Note**: Resuming execution doesn't restore chat history or previous requirement prompts, but can continue operating on files in the working directory.

#### ⚡ Set Execution Rounds
Control the maximum number of task execution rounds to prevent infinite loops.

```bash
python main.py --loops 5 -r "Task description"
python main.py -d "my_dir" -l 10 -r "Task description"
```

> **Info**: Rounds don't equal model calls. Each round typically calls the LLM once, but additional calls may occur for history summarization when chat logs become too long, plus optional task summarization at completion.

#### 🔧 Custom Model Configuration
Specify API configuration directly via command line, though we recommend configuring in `config.txt` for reusability.

```bash
python main.py --api-key YOUR_KEY --model gpt-4 --api-base https://api.openai.com/v1
```

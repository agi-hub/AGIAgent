# **AGIAgent-ColourfulDoc: Rich Image Document Writing Feature Introduction**

Do you find that documents generated by ordinary large language models contain only text without images, making them dry and uninteresting? Try AGIAgent, the world's only fully autonomous agent that supports automatic insertion of 5 types of image formats into documents, creating richly illustrated content that makes documents colourful and insightful.

Its features include:

1.  Supports generation of rich illustrated reports with diverse images (Mermaid diagrams, SVG diagrams, Google/Baidu image search, AI-generated images, code-generated images), where large models can directly output mixed text and image layout formats;

2.  Supports long document generation, capable of producing complete reports, applications, papers, patents, etc., reaching 30-50 pages in length;

3.  Elegant writing style similar to academic papers and in-depth reports, unlike ordinary large models that only list points without writing details, AGIAgent's writing is more professional and human-like, suitable for in-depth writing applications;
